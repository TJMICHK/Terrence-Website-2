          I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a deep curiosity for how systems work — both mechanical and human. 
          I enjoy designing, building, and understanding the connections between hardware, software, and real-world problem solving. 
          My ambitions lie in creating technology that serves people — from embedded systems to robotics and beyond.

          I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and turning ideas into tangible results. 
          Whether I'm experimenting in the lab, leading a team, or exploring new ideas, 
          I aim to bring creativity, precision, and purpose to every project I take on.
